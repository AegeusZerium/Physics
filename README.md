## Numerical Simulation of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The Notebook is an elucidation of **Newton's law of universal gravitation**, one of Isaac's monumental contributions to the field of physics. 

The programming language and scientific libraries used to simulate Newton's law are as follows:

- Python 3.7.3
- Numpy 1.16.2
- Matplotlib 3.0.3
